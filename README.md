The Idea behind RustyVault is to make a simple decentralised key vault to store secrets and what not!

## Note ! ##
This project is still in development, so please be aware that it may contain bugs or unfinished features. The decentralization logic is added but yet needs to improve and make a way to be accessible from the web.

### The Idea ###
By using the functionality of a `HashMap` we are creating `Nodes` of Vaults. These `Nodes` are basically newer instance of the Vaults.
in the upcoming iterations of the project I am supposed to add a functionality where we can Decentralize the Vaults over the Internet. 
I have been using this for personal use, but I am open to other ideas or contributions that can be made to the project.
